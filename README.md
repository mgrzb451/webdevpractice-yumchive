# Yumchive - the Yummy Archive ðŸ˜‚

My most extensive practice project yet and the culmination of the really good Javascript course I've been following.

[Pages demo](https://mgrzb451.github.io/webdevpractice-yumchive/)

## What I learned

I learned quite a few new things and concepts (among them `localStorage`, `FormData`) and managed to get a lot of practice and refinement to what I already knew (e.g. working with JS `Class`es and `Object`s).

The biggest new topic I learned was the Model-View-Controller architecture and the Publisher-Subscriber Pattern. These two concepts seem absolutely revolutionary to me and I fell totally in love with them.
This is only my first implementation and I've been learning as I go and I already have a massive number of improvements I want to include in my next proujects!
I can see how this type of architecture and data flow pattern will extend seamlessly to my Python projects as well!
